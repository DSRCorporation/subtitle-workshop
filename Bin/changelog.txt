==========================================================================================================



* GENERAL INTERFACE CHANGES:
	--> TOOLBAR added - (show/hide from "View: Toolbar"). Note that the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons offer a dropdown list with the last Undo/Redo actions, so you can Undo/Redo multiple actions at once.
	--> STATUSBAR added	- (show/hide from "View: Statusbar"). Displays the current subtitles format and the number of the currently selected subtitle(s). Left mouse button click on the number centers the Subtitles List on the first (or only) selected subtitle. Right mouse button click on the number centers the Subtitles List on the last (or only) selected subtitle.
	--> FULL TAGS SUPPORT MODE (Multiple Tags Mode) added - currently only for the SubRip, MicroDVD, and Sub Station Alpha formats. To enable it, select "Multiple tags mode" in "Settings: Settings: General". The subtitles in the Video Preview Panel are also properly formatted when using the Multiple Tags Mode. Tags that can be used while editing are:
		--> <b> and </b> - Bold text.
		--> <i> and </i> - Italic text.
		--> <u> and </u> - Underlined text.
		--> <c:#RRGGBB> and </c> - Text color.
		Always work with those tags in Subtitle Workshop. When saving the subtitle files, they are properly converted to the corresponding tags of the chosen format. Note that the MicroDVD format supports only tags for entire lines or subtitles, but not for separate words or characters.
	--> TEXT STYLE BARS added - (show/hide them from "View: Text style bars"). They consist of style tags buttons. They appear above the "Text" and "Translation" fields. They have similar behaviour to that of the Microsoft Word buttons.
	--> "PAUSE" editbox added - to display and set the pause between the current and the previous subtitle.	
	--> "PAUSE" column added in the Subtitles List.
	--> "DURATION" column added in the Subtitles List.	
	--> When you right-click the column titles ("Num", "Show", "Hide", "Text", "Translation", "Duration", or "Pause") of the Subtitles List, a new Subtitles List Header Context Menu pops up that allows you to show/hide the different columns.
	--> The columns positions are now automatically saved.
	--> When the "Text" and "Translation" columns positions are swapped, the "Text" and "Translation" fields are automatically swapped as well.
	--> When the "Show" column header in the Subtitles List is clicked, the "Sort" function ("Edit: Subtitles: Sort") is executed (subtitles are sorted by their Show Time).
	--> When the "Text" or "Translation" column header in the Subtitles List is clicked, the widths of the "Text" and "Translation" columns become equal.
	--> The values in the "Show", "Hide", "Duration", and "Pause" boxes can now be edited with the mouse scroll wheel, when you're inside those boxes. If you hold the CTRL key while scrolling, the decrease/increase value will be 10 times larger. If you hold the ALT key while scrolling, the decrease/increase value will be 2 times smaller. The increase/decrease step can be set in "Settings: Settings: General: Advanced". If you hold the SHIFT key while scrolling, the duration is not changed at all, but rather the subtitle is shifted in time (similar to using "Edit: Timings: Shift +N milliseconds" and "Edit: Timings: Shift -N milliseconds").
	--> When the mouse cursor is over one of the time boxes ("Show", "Hide", "Duration", or "Pause"), the corresponding time value can now be set by using the mouse scroll wheel, without entering (clicking in) the box. Subtitle Workshop indicates this by underlining the time value in the corresponding box. Using the CTRL and ALT, keys to modify the step, or the SHIFT key to shift the subtitle is possible.
	--> Pause, Show, Hide, and Duration values can now be changed in the Subtitles List with the mouse scroll wheel, when the corresponding cell is clicked and the left mouse button is held down while scrolling with the mouse scroll wheel. Using the CTRL and ALT, keys to modify the step is possible.
	--> The following shortcuts are enabled for the Subtitles List:
		--> SHIFT + mouse scroll wheel - shift the currently selected subtitle(s) in time (like using "Edit: Timings: Set delay" for the selected subtitles, but easier).
		--> "S" + mouse scroll wheel - modify the Show Time of the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> "D" (or "E") + mouse scroll wheel - modify the Hide Time of the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> SAPCE - Mark or unmark the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> "B" (or "O") - Set/unset Bold tag for the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> "I" - Set/unset Italic tag for the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> "U" - Set/unset Underline tag for the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> "C" (or "Y") - Set/unset a Color tag (the last selected color in the color dialog) for the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> BACKSPACE - Remove all tags for the currently selected subtitle(s).
		--> ENTER - Move the video to the Show Time of the focused subtitle. Also, start "in-place edition", if exactly one subtitle is selected and "in-place edition" is enabled. Also, save and exit "in-place edition".
		--> F2 - Start "in-place edition" / Save and exit "in-place edition".
		--> ESCAPE - Unselect all selected subtitles and leave only the focused subtitle selected. Or cancel edition in "in-place edition".
		--> LEFT/RIGHT - Change the focused column.		
		--> PageUP/PageDOWN - Change the current subtitle in "in-place edition".
		--> TAB/SHIFT+TAB - Change the current column in "in-place edition".
	--> Right-click selection can be enabled in the Subtitles List (from "Settings: Settings: Look: List: Right click selection").
	--> "Insert subtitle", "Insert before", "Remove selected", and "Remove all tags" added to the Context Menu of the Subtitles List.
	--> When a subtitle with Bad Values is selected, it's duration is now displayed as 00:00:00,000 instead of 23:XX;XX,XXX.
	--> "OCR Scripts" checkbox added in the Left Panel for fast enabling/disabling of the OCR Script errors checking and fixing.
	--> "Notes" field added to the Left Panel of Subtitle Workshop (show/hide it from "View: Show notes in left panel"). The notes are global for the entire program and not dependant on the current subtitle file(s). Set the charset of the "Notes" field in "Settings: Settings: Charsets: Notes charset".	
	--> Accurate charset conversion when using Paste operations.
	--> Select All, Cut, Copy, and Paste (and their shortcuts) now available for all textboxes, dropboxes, and other controls throughout Subtitle Workshop (e.g.: pressing CTRL+A ("Edit: Select all") in the "Text" or "Translation" fields selects the entire text in the filed now, not all subtitles in the Subtitles List).
	--> The width of the Time Controls Area and Text Controls Area can now be resized via a new horizontal splitter located between them.
	--> Four new time control buttons added in the Time Controls Area (show/hide from "View: Show time control buttons"). Each button has two functions - one when it's clicked with the left mouse button, and another when it's clicked with the right mouse button. The buttons' functions (their tooltips also indicate them) are as follows (left click function/right click function): "Move to Previous/Extend to Previous"; "Move to Next/Extend to Next"; "Set Default Pause/Set Default Pause, if Pause is too short"; "Set Auto Duration/Set Min Duration".
	--> Now, when no subtitles are selected in the Subtitles List, the "Show", "Hide", "Duration", and "Pause" boxes, the time control buttons, the "Text" and "Translation" fields, and the style tags buttons are disabled.
	--> Now, when two or more subtitles are selected in the Subtitles List, the values of the "Show", "Hide", "Duration", and "Pause" boxes are filled as follows: "Show" displays the Show Time of the first selected subtitle; "Hide" displays the Hide Time of the last selected subtitle; "Pause" displays the pause of the first selected subtitle; "Duration" displays the total duration of all subtitles (including the pauses between them).
		--> When two or more subtitles are selected in the Subtitles List, setting the same duration value for all selected subtitles by the "Duration" box is now possible.
		--> When two or more subtitles are selected in the Subtitles List, increasing/decreasing the duration of all selected subtitles is now possible by using the mouse scroll wheel on the "Duration" box. The same is also valid for the Show Time of all selected subtitles (using the "Show" box) and Hide Time of all selected subtitles (using the "Hide" box).
	--> When typing in the "Text" or "Translation" fields, one Undo entry is now added for an entire word, instead of for every single letter. However, if nothing is typed in for more than 2 seconds, a new Undo entry will be added the next time text is typed in.
	--> The program version number is displayed in the main window's caption.
	--> The taskbar caption of Subtitle Workshop now displays the name of the file first.
	--> Now, when a file is modified, that's indicated by an asterisk (*) in Subtitle Workshop's caption.
	--> New Context Menu added for the "Text" and "Translation" fields. It contains the following items: "Cut", "Copy", "Paste", "Delete", "Select all", "Italic", "Bold", "Underline", "Set color", "Remove color tags", "Remove all tags".	
	--> IN-PLACE EDITION:
		--> The Translation and the Show Time and Hide Time values can now be edited with "in-place edition".
		--> The Pause and Duration values can now be edited using "in-place edition".
		--> Time values can now be modified with the mouse scroll wheel when using "in-place edition".		
		--> When using "in-place edition", the popup edition boxes now have the same alignment as the corresponding cell in the Subtitles List.
	--> System menu and Close button added to all modal windows.
	--> The color value of the Color Tag Dialog is now automatically saved.

	--> Volume Control added - set the volume of the video.
	--> "Mute/Unmute" button added - mute or unmute the volume of the video.
	--> Full Screen Mode added. Toggle it with a left mouse button double click (if "Settings: Settings: Video preview: Enter Full Screen on double click" is enabled) or a middle mouse button single click on the Video Preview Panel, or through the new Video Preview Context Menu. In Full Screen Mode, the mouse cursor automatically hides in a few seconds if not used. While in Full Screen Mode, the video control buttons are in a hidden bar on the bottom of the screen. Move the mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen to display them, and move it away to hide them again. The "Settings: Settings: Video preview: Subtitles: Relative font size" option is recommended for Full Screen Mode. "Toggle Scroll List" is automatically turned on in Full Screen Mode (and if it was previously off, it is turned back off when you exit Full Screen Mode).
	--> The following shortcuts are now available when the mouse cursor is over the Video Preview Panel:
		--> MOUSE WHEEL UP - Increase volume.
		--> MOUSE WHEEL DOWN - Decrease volume.
		--> MOUSE LEFT BUTTON DOUBLE CLICK - Toggle Full Screen Mode (if "Settings: Settings: Video preview: Enter Full Screen on double click" is enabled).

	--> Show Time and Hide Time values can now be set by clicking with the mouse on the Time Counter below the video. Clicking with the left mouse button will set the Show Time, clicking with the right mouse button will set the Hide Time. In addition, while the mouse button (left or right) is held down, the mouse scroll wheel can be used to further modify the corresponding (Show or Hide) time value.
	--> If the SHIFT key is held when setting the Show Time/Hide Time via clicking on tha "Set Show Time"/"Set Hide Time" button or on the Time Counter, the Show Time/Hide Time will be set and then the subtitle will be shifted in time.
	--> If more than one subtitles are selected when setting the Show Time/Hide Time via clicking on tha "Set Show Time"/"Set Hide Time" button or on the Time Counter, the Show Time of the first selected subtitle/the Hide Time of the last selected subtitle will be set and then all selected subtitles will be shifted in time accordingly.
	--> The Video Preview Panel height ratio (in relation to the Subtitles List) is now kept and automatically saved.
	--> When the mouse cursor is over the Volume Control, a tooltip with the current volume per cent is now displayed.
	--> The Time Counter below the video now displays the video time at the current mouse cursor position, when the mouse cursor is moved over the Seekbar.

	--> The Seekbar now contains color blocks for visual subtitle representation ("View: Visual subtitle representation" to show/hide them).		
	--> Also see "Settings: Settings: Video preview" and "Settings: Settings: Video preview: Subtitles".


* "FILE" MENU:
	--> The "Save as" window can be resized now.
	--> "Save Marking" added - save the subtitle marking in a SRF file (like in ViPlay). The SRF file is created in the same folder the current subtitles are in. The file is given the following name: <subtitle file name> + <subtitle file extension> + <.srf> (e.g. for C:\SubRip.sub, C:\SubRip.sub.srf is created). If a translation file is opened, a SRF file is saved for it too.

	--> "Style" added - it contains the following items: "Italic", "Bold", "Underline", "Set color", "Remove color tags", "Remove all tags".
	--> "Invert selection" added.	
	"TIMINGS" MENU:
		--> "Set duration limits...":
			--> A new option "Increase at start if necessary" added - if the desired duration is not achieved by increasing the Hide value of the subtitle, the Show value is decreased. The subtitle will show up earlier, but it will eventually have the desired duration.
		--> "Set delay":
			--> Window modified - "+"/"-" dropdown box replaced with more convenient radio buttons. Mouse scroll wheel can be used to set the value. The PLUS and MINUS keys can be used to set "+"/"-".
			--> A new option "From first selected until last subtitle" added - applies the delay for all subtitles from the first selected subtitle until the last subtitle.			
		--> "Extend length" renamed to "Extend length to next".
		--> "Extend length to previous" added - set the Start time of the current subtitle just after the End time of the previous one (similar to "Extend length").
		--> "Shift to next" added - shifts the selected subtitle(s) to the next subtitle.
		--> "Shift to previous" added - shifts the selected subtitle(s) to the previous subtitle.		
		--> "Automatic Durations":
			--> A new option "Increase at start if necessary" added - if the desired duration is not achieved by increasing the Hide value of the subtitle, the Show value is decreased. The subtitle will show up earlier, but it will eventually have the desired duration.
		--> "Set Pauses" added - sets the pauses between subtitles. Set the pause value and the applied method in the window that pops up.
		--> "Round Time Values..." added - rounds all the time values to a selected value.
		--> A new ("CPS") method added in "Automatic Durations".
	"TEXTS" MENU:
		--> "Smart Line Adjust" added - works like the old "Smart Line Adjust" (now called "Fast smart line adjust"), but has some additional settings - it can break the text on dialogue dashes and punctuation marks ("Break on punctuation marks" method); it can be set not to unbreak subtitles with the "Don't unbreak subtitles that are not too long" option (e.g. this: "Hello.|How are you?" will NOT be changed to "Hello. How are you?"); it can be set not to modify normal subtitles with the "Adjust only long subs and subs with more than 2 lines" option (e.g. this: "What do you think|for my new lovely collection?" will NOT be changed to "What do you think for my|new lovely collection?"), which preserves the original look of those subtitles and doesn't break their readability. If the "Always try to find a better breaking point" option (for the "Break on punctuation marks" method) is checked, Subtitle Workshop will always try to find a better break point; if it's not checked - Subtitle Workshop will try to find a better break point only if the previous break point is not a punctuation mark already.
		--> "Unbreak subtitles" added - works like the old "Unbreak subtitles" (now called "Fast unbreak subtitles"), but has some additional settings - you can set a maximum line lenght ("Don't unbreak if line length exceeds"), and set it not to unbreak subtitles with dialogue ("Don't unbreak subtitles with "-" on second line").
		--> Old "Smart line adjust" renamed to "Fast smart line adjust".
		--> Old "Unbreak subtitles" renamed to "Fast unbreak subtitles".
	"SUBTITLES" MENU:
		--> "Auto Combine Subtitles" added - a new function to automatically combine short subtitles. You can set which subtitles should be considered for combining by setting a maximum duration and a minimum CPS. The most important option is the "Punctuation marks detection" - when this option is turned on, the function will combine only lines of the same person (judging by the punctuation marks), so you won't have to add dialogue dashes afterwards. If you don't care whether the lines of different characters are divided by dialogue dashes or not (not recommended), turn it off.
			--> "Combine if duration is less than" - combine only subtitles that have a duration less than this value.
			--> "Combine if CPS is greater than" - combine only subtitles that have more CPS than this value.
			--> "Don't combine if pause is greater than" - don't combine two subtitles, if the pause between them is greater than this value.
			--> "Punctuation marks detection" - combine only lines of the same character (judging by the punctuation marks: e.g. if the first subtitle ends on a comma or on no punctuation mark, the second subtitle is a line of the same character; if the first subtitle ends on a dot, a question mark or an exclamation mark, the second subtitle MIGHT be a line of a different character, so the two subtitles won't be combined).
			--> "Combined subtitles maximum duration" - when the two subtitles are combined, the resulting subtitle's duration shouldn't exceed that value.
			--> "Decrease duration if necessary with no more than" - if the above value is exceeded, decrease the duration a bit (set how much with this value) and check again.
			--> "Combined subtitles maximum line length" - maximum line length of the combined subtitle.
		--> "Delete dots at the beginning" added - deletes dots in the beginning of every subtitle (unlike "Delete unnecessary links" it doesn't delete the dots in the end of the subtitles and doesn't consider them at all).
		--> "Delete unnecessary links":
			--> It now detects more dots types (not just three, but two or more than three dots), and also ignores spaces between them.
		--> "Jump to next marked" added - jump to the next marked subtitle.
		--> "Jump to previous marked" added - jump to the previous marked subtitle.


* "TOOLS: INFORMATION AND ERRORS" MENU:	
	--> "Show CPS boxes" added - show/hide CPS Infoboxes for each subtitle. See the changes in "Tools: Information and errors: Settings: Advanced" for more information.
	--> "Jump to next error":
		--> It can now jump from the last error to the first.
	--> "Jump to previous error" added.
	"INFORMATION AND ERRORS..." WINDOW (extended with multiple new functions and indicators):
		--> The Info&Errors Window is no longer modal (can stay opened at all times). All the information in it is automatically refreshed when changes occur in the Main Window if the "Tools: Information and Errors: Settings: Automatically recheck errors" is checked (currently this slows down the speed of Subtitle Workshop a little bit, so only keep the "Information and Errors" window opened when really necessary).
		--> The Info&Errors Window can be resized now, and the Info&Errors List columns' widths resize automatically.
		--> The Info&Errors List can now be sorted by every column.
		--> The total number of errors and fixed errors are now in a separate label, always visible.
		--> New "E" (Errors), "W" (Warnings), "F" (Fixed), and "CI" (Custom info) buttons added - they show or hide the corresponding type of information in the Info&Errors List.
		--> New "<" and ">" buttons added - they jump to the previous / next row in the Info&Errors List.
		--> New "Select" button added - selects all subtitles in the Main Window that are currently in the Info&Errors List.
		--> New "+ Select" button added - adds to the current selection in the Main Window all subtitles that are currently in the Info&Errors List.
		--> New "- Select" button added - removes from the current selection in the Main Window all subtitles that are currently in the Info&Errors List.
		--> New "Export to file" button added - exports the Info&Errors List content to a text file.
		--> ERROR TYPES AREA (new area):
			--> This area can be shown/hidden with the new "Error types" button.
			--> This area contains a list of all error types and how many of each of them the current subtitle file contains.
			--> The checkbox in front of each error type will show/hide all instances of this error type in the Info&Errors List. The "All" button checks them all, the "None" button unchecks them all, and the "Inverse" button makes an inverse selection.
			--> The current state of the checkboxes can be saved in an Error Types Set under an assigned name. This way it is easy to switch between different sets of states. The desired name of the Error Types Set must be entered in the dropdown box and the ENTER key or the "Save error types set" button must be pressed to save an Error Types Set. An Error Types Set can be loaded by selecting it from the dropdown box. An Error Types Set can be deleted by loading it and then clicking on the "Delete error types set" button.
		--> CUSTOM INFO AREA (new area):
			--> This area can be shown/hidden with the new "Custom info" button.
			--> Here, different specific rules can be set to look for certain subtitles. The subtitles that fit those rules will be displayed in the Info&Errors List as "Custom info" types of rows, and with a description containing the rule or the rule's caption.
			--> There are no Custom info fields at first. Add a new field with the "+" button or with its dropdown menu. The following Custom info rule types are available:
				a) "Composite custom info" (default when you press the "+" button): look for subtitles that fit several rules simultaneously:
					--> When a "Composite custom info" is added, a new window - the Composite Custom Info Window - appears where all the Composite custom info's sub-rules can be set. Enter the name of the Composite custom info in the "Caption" field. With a Composite custom info, Subtitle Workshop can look for subtitles that fit several rules simultaneously. Those rules can be the same as the other Custom info rule types ("Duration", "Line length", "Line count", "Pause", "CPS", and "Text" - see their description below). Add new subrules with the "+" button.
						Example: To find all subtitles that have two lines and a duration less than 1.5 seconds, add a "Composite custom info" with the "+" button. Enter a name for this rule in the "Caption" field. Click on the "+" button in the Composite Custom Info Window below and add a "Subtitles duration information" subfield, and after its "<" sign enter the number 1500. Click on the "+" button again and add a "Subtitles lines count information" subfield and after its ">" sign enter the number 1, after its "<" sign enter the number 3, and from the dropdown select "AND". This way Subtitle Workshop will be looking for subtitles with a duration < 1500 ms, having more than one and less than three (exactly two) lines. Click the "Ok" button to finish editing the Composite custom info.
					--> The "Composite custom info" type fields contain an "Edit" button - when clicked, the Composite Custom Info Window appears.
				b) "Subtitles duration information":
					--> This field type has two textboxes (for two rule values: ">" - greater than, and "<" - less than) - enter the desired number (in milliseconds) in them. You can also select a logical connection between the rules from the dropdown box ("AND" - look for subtitles fitting both conditions; "OR" - look for subtitles fitting at least one of the conditions). You can enter only one value and leave the other field and the dropdown box empty if you wish.
					Example 1: To look for all subtitles with a duration of less than 1 second, add a "Duration information" type of field with the "+" button, and enter the number 1000 after the "<" sign, and press the ENTER key.
					Example 2: To look for subtitles with a duration between 6 and 7 seconds, add another "Duration information" type of field with the "+" button, and enter 6000 after ">", and 7000 after "<", select the "AND" logical connection from the dropdown, and press the ENTER key.
					Example 3: To look for subtitle with a duration that is either less than 6 seconds or greater than 7 seconds, add another "Duration information" type of field with the "+" button, and enter 7000 after ">", and 6000 after "<",select the "OR" logical connection from the dropdown, and press the ENTER key.
				c) "Subtitles line length information":
					--> It has the same fields as the "Duration" field type and works the same way, but for subtitles line length (in characters).
				d) "Subtitles line count information":
					--> It has the same fields as the "Duration" field type and works the same way, but for subtitles lines count (in lines).
				e) "Subtitles pause information":
					--> It has the same fields as the "Duration" field type and works the same way, but for subtitles pause (in milliseconds).
				f) "Subtitles CPS information":
					--> It has the same fields as the "Duration" field type and works the same way, but for subtitles CPS (in characters per second).
				g) "Subtitles text information":
					--> This type of field contains a textbox for the text you're looking for in a subtitle and a dropdown that sets the type of the search that will be performed for that text. The text search types are:
					a) Contains (Case sensitive) - The rule is to look for subtitles that contain the entered text. The search will be case sensitive.
					b) Contains (Case insensitive) - The rule is to look for subtitles that contain the entered text. The search will not be case sensitive.
					c) Does not contain (Case sensitive) - The rule is to look for subtitles that do not contain the entered text. The search will be case sensitive.
					d) Does not contain (Case insensitive) - The rule is to look for subtitles that do not contain the entered text. The search will not be case sensitive.
					e) Matches regular expression - This option indicates that the entered text will be treated as a regular expression. Regular expressions are explained in Subtitle Workshop's Help in 5.5.4 Syntax of Regular Expressions.
					f) Matches regular expression (ignore tags) - like e), but all tags in the subtitles are ignored.
					Example: To find all subtitles containing the word "ship", whether it is written with small letters or with one or more capital letters, select "Contains (Case insensitive)" from the dropdown and enter the text "ship" in the textbox.
				A new custom info field is added in the Custom Infos List, when you add one of the custom info rules types.
			-->	There's a checkbox in front of each custom info field to enable or disable that rule (show/hide subtitles in the Info&Errors List that fit that rule).
			--> The "Delete" button of a field deletes that field.
			--> The number of the subtitles that fit the rule will be displayed on the left of the "Delete" button of the field.			
			--> The "All", "None", and "Inverse" buttons work in the same fashion as the "All", "None", and "Inverse" buttons in the Error Types Area.
			--> The "Save custom info set" and "Delete custom info set" buttons, and the custom info set dropdown box can be used to save sets of Custom info fields, just like the Error types sets in the Error Types Area.		
			--> There is a vertical slider above the Custom Info Area, that can be used to resize the height of the Custom Info Area.		
	"VARIOUS INFORMATION..." WINDOW:
		--> The window is no longer modal (can stay opened at all times). However note that the information in it is NOT automatically refreshed after each change in the Main Window of Subtitle Workshop and must be refreshed manually.
		--> New "Refresh info" button added - refresh the various information.
		--> New information is shown in the "Information" page:
			--> Longest duration - the number of the subtitle with the longest duration and its duration.
			--> Shortest duration - the number of the subtitle with the shortest duration and its duration.
			--> Longest Pause - the number of the subtitle with the longest pause in relation to its previous subtitle and the duration of that pause.
			--> Shortest Pause - the number of the subtitle with the shortest pause in relation to its previous subtitle and the duration of that pause.
			--> Longest Line - the number of the subtitle with the longest line and how many characters that line is.
			--> Shortest Line - the number of the subtitle with the shortest line and how many characters that line is.
			--> Most CPS - the number of the subtitle with the most characters per second and how many exactly they are.

	"SETTINGS..." WINDOW:
		--> New error types added:
			--> "Unnecessary tags" - checks for: repeated tags (e.g. <i><i>); empty tags (e.g. <i></i>); opening tags after closing tags (e.g. </i><i>). Those errors can also be automatically corrected (See "Tools: Information and Errors: Settings: Fix").
			--> "Dash on first line" - check for a dash on the first line of subtitles with more than one line (e.g. the Bulgarian standard for dialogue in subtitles is to have a dash only on the second line). Those errors can also be automatically corrected (See "Tools: Information and Errors: Settings: Fix").
				--> "Only if there is no "-" on second line" - a suboption to look only for multiline subtitles starting with a dash, but without other dashes (i.e. without dialogue) - e.g. suitable for English subtitles where dashes are used on both lines of a dialogue.
			--> "Too many CPS" - Check for a maximum allowed number of characters per second - a good way to evaluate the readability of the subtitles. Those errors can be marked with a very useful special CPS infobox above the subtitle text in the Main Window. Look for the changes in "Tools: Information and errors: Settings: Advanced" for more information.
			--> "Too short pause" - check for too short pauses between subtitles. The minimal pause is set in "Tools: Information and errors: Settings: Advanced".
			--> "Dialogue on one line" - check for dialogue on one line (in fact for a dash after a dot, a question mark or exclamation mark), something that isn't allowed in some standards. Those errors can also be automatically corrected (See "Tools: Information and Errors: Settings: Fix").	
		"GENERAL" TAB:
			--> The "Set color..." button and the "Bold", "Italic", and "Underline" checkboxes are removed (see the new "Mark" tab).
			--> "Automatically recheck errors" added - perform AUTOMATIC ERROR RECHECK after EVERY action (change) in Subtitle Workshop!
				--> "Do not recheck on Pascal scripts" - rechecking errors on Pascal scripts might be slow - this turns it off.
				--> "Recheck all once after a Pascal script executes" - recheck all errors after each Pascal script execution. This is recommended in most cases.
				--> "Recheck on each change made by a Pascal script (might be slow)" - might be slow, so only use it for scripts that don't make many modifications.
			--> "Indicate too long lines in Text and Translation labels" added - indicate too long lines in selected subtitle by changing the text and background color of the Text and Translation labels.
			--> "Indicate too short duration in Duration box" added - indicate too short duration in selected subtitle by changing the text and background color of the "Duration" box.

				--> "Normal CPS box colors" added - the text and background colors of the CPS Infobox when the CPS does not exceed the maximum CPS allowed. Those colors are used when "Tools: Information and errors: Show CPS boxes" is on.
				--> "Too much CPS box colors" - the text and background colors of the CPS Infobox when the CPS exceeds the maximum CPS allowed.
				--> "Display percentage in CPS box" - the CPS Infoboxes will contain the percentage of the currently used number of characters per second out of the allowed maximum (e.g. if the maximum is 15 CPS, a subtitle with duration of 2 seconds, will use 100% if it contains 30 characters, or 80% if it contains 24 characters, or 50% if it contains 15 characters, or 200% if it contains 60 characters, etc.).
				--> "Display current CPS in CPS box" - the CPS Infobox will contain the subtitles current CPS (its number of characters divided by its duration).
				--> "Display minimum time in CPS box" - the CPS Infobox will contain the minimum duration allowed (for the current number of characters) that will keep the subtitle's CPS within the allowed maximum.

				2) Select the text style of the marking of the error (B="Bold", I="Italic", U="Underline", S="Strikethrough").
				3) Select the text and background colors for the selected (in step 1) columns for the error in the two color boxes on the right (first box is the text color, second box is the background color).
			--> Unchecked error types won't be marked at all.
			--> "Default error marking" will be applied for all checked errors with no selected columns (i.e. don't select any columns for an error type to mark it with this default style).
			--> The "Set Default Styles" button sets the default Advanced Error Marking System set of styles.
			--> Currently, the order the errors are marked in the Main Window is the following: 1. The errors with the default marking are marked. 2. The errors with unique marking are marked in the order they appear in the "Mark" tab.
